These inexpensive earbuds work well for listening to music while you exercise or work around the house. Occasionally, they do get out of sync with each other. When this happens, getting them linked back up can be maddening. You'll know you're there's somehting wrong when you can only connect one at a time and you see two entries for "T21" in your bluetooth device list.

You can fix them though and it just takes a bit of patience.

1. Please make sure the earbuds are fully charged. 
2. Double tap the Multi-Function Button (MFB) and let both earbuds enter into pairing mode (orange and white lights flicker alternately).
3. Then, triple tap the MFB, with the orange and white lights quickly flash three times, the pairing history will be cleared. (This may not always work.)
4. After that, put the earbuds back into the case and close the case.
